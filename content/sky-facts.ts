/**
 * Every card and desk one-liner in the night sky (spec
 * docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-15-sky-objects-design.md §5-§7): one entry
 * per selectable thing, keyed by the same id the renderer uses (objects.json
 * ids, lowercase planet names, "moon", "iss", "milky-way", shower ids, IAU
 * constellation abbreviations).
 *
 * ⚠️ NO RUNTIME IMPORTS. scripts/test-sky-facts.mjs imports this file straight
 * into node. Types only.
 *
 * Rules, all binding (the plan's Task 3 spells them out):
 *   - Every number in an entry appears in one of its cited sources. No
 *     uncited claim. A quote is verbatim inside “curly quotes”; a paraphrase
 *     changes the wording, never the fact.
 *   - Voice-gated by scripts/check-voice.mjs with copy.ts's rules. The
 *     citation fields are the sources' own words and are not scanned; kind,
 *     oneLiner, body and visibility are. A quote that would trip the gate
 *     gets paraphrased instead.
 *   - `accessed` is the ISO date the source was actually read.
